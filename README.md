This is a simple, easy-to-use client-side captcha image generator package for Javascript and React.js. 
I developed this code firstly to produce a decent captcha image for front-end developers, 
second and most importantly to use a rollup module bundler for React projects that has easier configuration and smaller build size. 
You can use its configuration to make packages.
Its propery
